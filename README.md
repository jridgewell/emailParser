emailParser
===========

A Coding Practical before a job interview. I avoided using PHP's IMAP functions,
it seemed like cheating. This will parse the headers into an array, the message
body, and stores any attachments in a array. There is basic usage in the bottom
of the implementation.


What else is there to do?
-------------------------

* Write unit tests
* Implement attachments as their own class
* Implement a way to search for an attachment
